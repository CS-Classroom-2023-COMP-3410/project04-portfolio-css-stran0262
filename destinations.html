                    Known as Dracula's Castle, Bran Castle has ties to the real-life Vlad the Impaler, whose brutal actions inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula. The castle's eerie architecture, perched on a misty hill, adds to its Gothic charm. The history of torture, bloodshed, and supernatural myths surrounding the castle has made it one of the most hauntingly beautiful Gothic sites in the world. <a href="Destinations/bran_castle.html">Learn more ...</a>

Built in the 12th century, it has served as a spiritual center and a symbol of faith throughout centuries. The cathedral has been the site of countless pilgrimages, and it is said to house the Sancta Camisa, the tunic worn by the Virgin Mary during the birth of Christ, adding to its spiritual and mystical significance. <a href="Destinations/cathedral.html">Learn more ...</a>

                    A majestic avenue of beech trees lining a road, The Dark Hedges has an ethereal and haunting quality. Its appearance in Game of Thrones has only added to its mystique. The trees are said to be haunted by a "Grey Lady" ghost, and the surrounding folklore about the trees being cursed or magical contributes to its Gothic appeal. <a href="Destinations/dark_hedges.html">Learn more ...</a>
